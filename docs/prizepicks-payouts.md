- 5-pick: **10x** (5/5); **2x** (4/5); **0.4x** (3/5)
- 4-pick: **6x** (4/4); **1.5x** (3/4)
- 3-pick: **3x** (3/3); **1x** (2/3)

## Usage Notes

- Flex provides reduced payouts on a miss (or two, for 6-pick).
- When recommending entries, pick the lineup type that matches risk tolerance and acknowledge partial-hit outcomes for Flex.
